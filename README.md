# Survive The Internet - Photosharing
1. Download `Survive The Internet - Photosharing Image Modder.app` from the `apps` folder. (if you wish to inspect the code, the way this app was created was by running the commands found in `sti-images/app-create` whilst cd'd into the `sti-images` folder.)
2. Open the app. You may need to right click > open it.
3. The default paths WILL NOT WORK - use the Browse buttons to select a folder containing the .jpg, .jpeg and .png images you wish to use for the Input folder, and empty folders for the other two folders.
4. Delete everything from `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/The Jackbox Party Pack 4/The Jackbox Party Pack 4.app/Contents/Resources/macos/games/SurviveTheInternet/content/STIPhoto`, apart from the `Thumbnails` folder. Delete all files inside of the thumbnails folder, but don't delete the folder itself.
5. Copy the contents of the folder you selected for the main output of the program and paste them into `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/The Jackbox Party Pack 4/The Jackbox Party Pack 4.app/Contents/Resources/macos/games/SurviveTheInternet/content/STIPhoto`. Copy the contents of the folder you selected for the thumbnail output of the program and paste them into the `Thumbnails` folder inside of the folder you just pasted into.
